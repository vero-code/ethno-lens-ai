# Privacy Policy for EthnoLens AI

Last updated: October 29, 2025

EthnoLens AI ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and handle your information when you use our Adobe Express add-on ("Add-on").

## What Information We Collect

To provide and manage the service, we collect and store the following:

1.  **Anonymous User Identifier:** An anonymized, non-reversible identifier provided by Adobe to distinguish users. We **do not** store your name, email, or other directly identifiable personal information.
2.  **Service Usage Data:** Information related to your use of the Add-on, such as the number of analysis checks you perform, to manage service quotas.
3.  **Voluntary Feedback:** Information you provide, such as clicks on a button to express interest in future features.

## How We Use Your Information

* **To Provide the Service:** We use your identifier and usage data to manage and reset your monthly free quota.
* **To Improve the Product:** We use aggregated, anonymous data (like feature interest) to understand user needs and prioritize future development.

## Third-Party Services (Data Sharing)

* **Google Gemini API:** When you submit a request for analysis, the content of that request (e.g., text or images for analysis) is sent to the Google Generative AI (Gemini) API to generate a response. This data is processed by Google in accordance with their [AI/ML Data Usage Policy](https://cloud.google.com/terms/data-processing-addendum). Your anonymous identifier is **not** sent to Google.
* **Supabase:** All data we store is held securely in our Supabase database.

We **do not** sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your identifiable information to outside parties.

## Data Security

We implement security measures (including Supabase's Row Level Security) to maintain the safety of your information.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in our repository.
