## Tools

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Adobe Express Add-on API, Spectrum Web Components
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js (Containerized)
* **AI Model:** Google Gemini API (Flash model)
* **Database:** Supabase (for user limits)
* **Hosting:** Google Cloud Run (Serverless)
* **Containerization:** Docker
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (Deploy to Cloud Run workflow)
* **Build Tool:** @adobe/create-ccweb-add-on

## ✅ Reliability & Quota Handling

- 🛑 Cancelable AI requests — no wasted quota on aborted runs
- ⚙️ Two-phase usage confirmation (pending → confirmed) to ensure accurate quota billing
- 🧾 Atomic usage tracking in Supabase (no double-charge edge cases)
- 🌐 Graceful handling of network interruptions

## Setup

This project consists of two parts: a frontend add-on and a backend server. Both must be running simultaneously for local development.

**Prerequisites**

- Node.js and npm installed.
- An Adobe Developer account.
- The Adobe Express Add-on Development Tool installed and configured. See the [official guide](https://developer.adobe.com/express/add-ons/docs/guides/getting_started/local_development/dev_tooling/).


### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vero-code/ethno-lens-ai.git
    cd ethno-lens-ai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Setup environment variables:**
  -  Create a `.env` file in the project root.
  -  Add your API keys and credentials (see `.env.example` file).

### Running Locally

You will need two separate terminals open.

**Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server**

  ```bash
  node server.js
  ```

_Your backend is now running at `http://localhost:3000`._

**Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Add-on Server**

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

_Your add-on is now hosted and can be sideloaded in Adobe Express._

## Deployment

The backend is containerized using Docker and hosted on **Google Cloud Run** for high scalability and zero cold starts.

* **Workflow:** The `deploy-cloudrun.yml` workflow handles the build and deployment process.
* **Trigger:** Go to the "Actions" tab → Select "Deploy to Cloud Run" → Click "Run workflow".
* **Configuration:** Environment variables (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, etc.) are managed securely via the Google Cloud Console (Cloud Run Service → Variables & Secrets).
