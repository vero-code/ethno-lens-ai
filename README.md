## Setup

This project consists of two parts: a frontend add-on and a backend server. Both must be running simultaneously for local development.

**Prerequisites**

- Node.js and npm installed.
- An Adobe Developer account.
- The Adobe Express Add-on Development Tool installed and configured. See the [official guide](https://developer.adobe.com/express/add-ons/docs/guides/getting_started/local_development/dev_tooling/).


### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vero-code/ethno-lens-ai.git
    cd ethno-lens-ai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Setup environment variables:**
  -  Create a `.env` file in the project root.
  -  Add your API keys and credentials (see `.env.example` file).

### Running Locally

You will need two separate terminals open.

**Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server**

  ```bash
  node server.js
  ```

_Your backend is now running at `http://localhost:3000`._

**Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Add-on Server**

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

_Your add-on is now hosted and can be sideloaded in Adobe Express._

## Deployment

The backend server is configured for deployment on Render.
* The `deploy-render.yml` workflow in `.github/workflows` allows for manual deployment triggering via GitHub Actions ("Actions" tab -> "Deploy to Render" -> "Run workflow").
* Ensure necessary environment variables are set in the Render service settings.
